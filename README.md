#My Awesome Carousal

```jQuery``` is used to help in the DOM manipulation. Overall it is yet another jQuery plugin.

Developing a simple carousal from scratch. This carousal supports CSS transitions if available. Here are few of the features.

* Rotation toggle
* Pause on hover over the control elements
* Thumbnail navigation (optional)
* Fullscreen button
* To some extent responsive as it resizes with widow size.
* Clean code which can be extended and modified very easily.
* Before and after transition hooks where any custom function can be executed.
